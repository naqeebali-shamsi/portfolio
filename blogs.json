Hope you find this exciting as I\u00a0do!</p>\n<p>We were given this project to get familiar with the process in a <strong>non-textbook approach</strong> and understand our users better. We were sorted into groups of 5\u20138 students each and each group was assigned a different part of the house on which we had to prepare a case study <strong>defining</strong> the problems of the user related to that part of the house and come with <strong>ideas</strong> to solve them. Each member of a group would then go on interviewing the other members for their problems by considering them as their\u00a0users.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive right\u00a0in!</p>\n<h3>What is Design Thinking you\u00a0ask?</h3>\n<p>It is a process that starts with <em>empathizing </em>with the users and identifying their problems and gaining <strong>insights</strong> by putting yourself in their shoes. Then we <strong>define</strong> those problems and come up with <strong>ideas </strong>to solve those problems and come up with a solution that best solves the users\u2019 problems.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tvXP9flpwuIK-DsX.png\"><figcaption>Design Thinking\u00a0Process</figcaption></figure><h3>The Empathize Stage</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L0tRJ5l4C0J7RgNTJfR2YA.png\"></figure><p>This is the first and most important stage of the process as this is where we converse with the users and identify their problems through a series of questions.</p>\n<blockquote>Asking the right questions is what we\u2019ll need to master at this stage.

It is straightforward discomforting to the eyes and may lead to eye-problems if it continues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Ambient Noise: </strong><br>It is a distraction/discomfort to the ears of the user while\u00a0working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Aesthetics: </strong><br>2 users mentioned that good aesthetics of their workplace will help them sustain a good mood throughout the\u00a0workday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Uncomfortable seat/chair: </strong><br>This is important to the users as the chair is the piece of furniture that they spend most of their time during working hours and users feeling discomfort after being seated for a long time directly impacts their health and\u00a0work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Less floor space in the room: </strong><br>The room appears to be cluttered and the workspace looks unorganised and ugly to the user which could restrict the user\u2019s movement which is a form of discomfort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Charging port not near to the desk: </strong><br>This problem is fairly important as the user works mostly on their laptop, ipad and mobile phone device and to charge them, they have to move their devices in the range of the charging ports in their bedroom which is a great inconvenience while\u00a0working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>No furniture item to rest legs while sitting in a chair:</strong><br>This problem is important to the user as they want to rest their legs while sitting in a chair so that they\u2019re in a more comfortable position.</blockquote>\n<p>Now that we have defined problem statements, it is time to put on our creative hats and form ideas to solve the problems defined in this\u00a0stage</p>\n<h3>The Ideate\u00a0Stage</h3>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ac801b581d4cefcae509187ebb9596c7/href\">https://medium.com/media/ac801b581d4cefcae509187ebb9596c7/href</a><p>I was excited about this stage the most. I had a lot of ideas flowing through my head but, most of them unreal or impractical. I used the crazy 8 technique (8 ideas in 8 min for each problem) and noted down the ones which were\u00a0viable.</p>\n<blockquote>1. Buy a gaming chair or a chair with lumbar\u00a0support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. Buy a portable desk with built-in charging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. Organize and declutter the workspace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Install acoustic panels and or a rubber frame for the doors/windows to reduce noise from\u00a0outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>5. Buy an LED lamp/light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. Comfortable chair with built-in desk and charging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. Leg\u00a0stool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. Spike guard for extending the range of charging\u00a0points.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. To improve aesthetics, establish a desk and a chair in the workspace with the user\u2019s choice of\u00a0decor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. To improve aesthetics, indoor plants can be placed in the workspace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>11. Recliner chair with built-in desk and charging for ultimate\u00a0comfort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>12.

It is straightforward discomforting to the eyes and may lead to eye-problems if it continues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Ambient Noise: </strong><br>It is a distraction/discomfort to the ears of the user while\u00a0working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Aesthetics: </strong><br>2 users mentioned that good aesthetics of their workplace will help them sustain a good mood throughout the\u00a0workday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Uncomfortable seat/chair: </strong><br>This is important to the users as the chair is the piece of furniture that they spend most of their time during working hours and users feeling discomfort after being seated for a long time directly impacts their health and\u00a0work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Less floor space in the room: </strong><br>The room appears to be cluttered and the workspace looks unorganised and ugly to the user which could restrict the user\u2019s movement which is a form of discomfort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>Charging port not near to the desk: </strong><br>This problem is fairly important as the user works mostly on their laptop, ipad and mobile phone device and to charge them, they have to move their devices in the range of the charging ports in their bedroom which is a great inconvenience while\u00a0working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>- <strong>No furniture item to rest legs while sitting in a chair:</strong><br>This problem is important to the user as they want to rest their legs while sitting in a chair so that they\u2019re in a more comfortable position.</blockquote>\n<p>Now that we have defined problem statements, it is time to put on our creative hats and form ideas to solve the problems defined in this\u00a0stage</p>\n<h3>The Ideate\u00a0Stage</h3>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/ac801b581d4cefcae509187ebb9596c7/href\">https://medium.com/media/ac801b581d4cefcae509187ebb9596c7/href</a><p>I was excited about this stage the most.

To improve aesthetics, indoor plants can be placed in the workspace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>11. Recliner chair with built-in desk and charging for ultimate\u00a0comfort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>12.
